# Canvas Assignment Assistant MCP Server

## Overview

This Model Context Protocol (MCP) server runs as a **Cloudflare Worker** using Server-Sent Events (SSE). 

It lets you interact with Canvas/Instructure courses and assignments, without leaving your LLM (e.g. Claude Desktop).

It allows you to retrieve, search, and summarize course and assignment information programmatically, for example to check due dates for upcoming assignments:

## How to Use This MCP Server 

You can use this Canvas MCP server with tools like Claude Desktop or Cursor that support MCP integrations. Here's how to get started:

### 1. Get Your Canvas API Token

1. Log in to your Canvas account in your web browser.
2. Click on your profile/account icon (usually in the top left or top right).
3. Go to **Settings**.
4. Scroll down to the **Approved Integrations** section.
5. Click **New Access Token**.
6. Give it a name (e.g., "MCP Integration") and click **Generate Token**.
7. Copy the token that appears. **Keep this token safe!**

For more details, see [Canvas's official instructions](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Basics-Guide/How-do-I-manage-API-access-tokens-in-my-user-account/ta-p/615312).

### 2. Add Your Token and Canvas Domain to Your MCP Integration

You can provide your Canvas API token and domain in two ways:

#### **A. As Query Parameters in the URL (Easy for Integrations)**

Just add your Canvas domain and token to the URL, for example:

```
https://canvas-mcp-server.mbcrosier.workers.dev/sse?canvas_domain=YOUR_SCHOOL_DOMAIN&token=YOUR_CANVAS_TOKEN
```

- This works well for integrations (like Zapier or some LLM tools) that only support URL-based configuration.
- **Security Note:** Anyone with this URL can access your Canvas data. Keep it private and do not share it.

#### **B. Using the Authorization Header (More Secure, Preferred)**

- Pass your token in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <token>`.
- Pass your Canvas domain as a query parameter (`?canvas_domain=...`) or as an `X-Canvas-Domain` header.

## Notes

- If you have trouble connecting, double-check your token and domain for typos.
